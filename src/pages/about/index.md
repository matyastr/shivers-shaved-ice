    content: Sometimes the simpler things are, the better! What's not to love about
      a classic ice cream parlor? From the retro-themed decor to the tall soft
      serve cone covered in sprinkles (or jimmies!), they scream nostalgia to
      me. We're bringing all of those feelings to the forefront with Sprink &
      Jimmy's!

  - title: About me
    content: Hi, I'm Allison. I've always had an affinity for ice cream. In fact,
      I've spent a lot of summer months working in an ice cream shop and make
      sure to indulge in some local favorites any time I travel. I've learned a
      lot and I've tried a lot, but my favorite have always remained the classic
      flavors and experiences inspired by retro ice cream parlors. Whether you
      say sprinkles or jimmies, we have something to share with everyone!
