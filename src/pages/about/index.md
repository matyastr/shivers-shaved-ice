    content: Some of our favorite family memories have come from getting shaved ice and
      and spending that time together. Life moves way too fast. We believe its best to
      slow down, grab a cup, sit down, and enjoy spending time with one another.

  - title: About us
    content: We are Allison and Tim. We've always had an affinity for shaved ice, ice
      cream, and all frozen desserts! We make it a point to regularly stop for a tasty treat, 
      either locally or while travelling.
      
      Allison brings years of experience in the ice cream industry and holds an MBA. She 
      spent many years working at a local ice cream shop learning the skills needed for the 
      frozen dessert industry. 

      Tim has worked many years in the software engineering industry. He brings an 
      entrepreneurial and problem-solving mind-set to Shivers and has always had a dream of 
      owning our own business. 
      
      We are excited to bring our skills and talents together to make Shivers Shave Ice
      a success!
