    content: Sometimes the simpler things are, the better! What's not to love about
      a classic ice cream parlor? From the retro-themed decor to the tall soft
      serve cone covered in sprinkles (or jimmies!), they scream nostalgia to
      me. We're bringing all of those feelings to the forefront with Sprink &
      Jimmy's!

  - title: About me
    content: Hi, I'm Allison. I've always had an affinity for ice cream. In fact,
      I've spent a lot of summer months working in an ice cream shop and make
      sure to indulge in some local favorites any time I travel. I've learned a
      lot and I've tried a lot, but my favorite have always remained the classic
      flavors and experiences inspired by retro ice cream parlors. Whether you
      say sprinkles or jimmies, we have something to share with everyone!

### Shade-grown coffee
Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
